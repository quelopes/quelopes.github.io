# a summary about you
summary: 'I’m a biologist by training with 13 years of bioinformatics and computational biology experience. I got my doctoral and master’s degrees in Computational Modeling at National Laboratory for Scientific Computing - [LNCC](www.lncc.br), in Petrópolis, Brazil. Since then, I’ve been working on different bioinformatics projects especially related to cancer molecular analysis, viruses, and hereditary cardiovascular diseases. In these projects, I worked with clinical data, and Next Generation Sequencing `NGS` analysis (from Whole Exome Sequencing WES, `RNA-seq`). Also, I analyzed data from microarray (Affymetrix) and methylation (450k) platforms. In computation approaches, I’ve been working with `data integration`, scientific workflows, virtualization (docker container), `HPC` (High-performance computing), and databases (relational and non-relational databases such as graph databases). I use R as the main language, but I also have experience in python and C.'
